# Proxy Configuration File (BACKUP ONLY)
# The system now fetches proxies directly from GitHub source
# This file is only used as a backup if GitHub source fails
# Format: protocol://[username:password@]host:port
# Or simply: host:port (assumes HTTP)
# Lines starting with # are ignored

# Add backup proxy servers here if needed:
# proxy1.example.com:8080
# user:pass@proxy2.example.com:3128
